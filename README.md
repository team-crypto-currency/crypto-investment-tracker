# Crypto Investment Tracker

## Description
This is a tool used to empower crypto currency investors to explore the prices of different coins without having to sign up for an exchange. The user has the option to save coins and view them on a "Saved Coins" page which is a restricted route via passport-local technology. All user information and saved coins are stored in a MySQL database. This fullstack web application runs on an Express server and is built with the Handlebars.js template engine.
